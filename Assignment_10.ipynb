    "\n",
    "* shutil.copy() will only copy one single file from the source path to the destination path.\n",

    "\n",
    "* send2trash.send2trash() function from send2trash module can help us to delete both files & directories and it will move the deleted file/directory to the trash/recycle bin so that the user can still recover it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the other hand, shutil.rmtree() function from shutil module can only help us to delete the entire directory and not a single file. Also, it will permanently delete the directory instead of moving it to the recycle bin. "
