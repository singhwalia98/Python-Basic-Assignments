    "\n",
    "Ans. A relative path refers to the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory. In other words, it is a path that is specified in relation to the directory where the user is currently located, rather than an absolute path that specifies the full path from the root directory of the file system."

    "2. Why does an absolute path start with your operating system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. An absolute path starts with the operating system because the file system is specific to the operating system on which the code is running. The file system on Windows-based systems is different from that on Unix-based systems such as Linux and macOS."
